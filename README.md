# Tictactoe
A tictactoe game with minimax algorithm with X being an AI opponent
The use of minimax alogrithm makes the AI "X" win each time, there are two instances, X going first at the top right corner as the alogrithm recognises it as the best spot while if "o" goes first, "X" starts in the middle which still inevitably means the "X" will win ultimately fulfilling the goal of "X" always winning or getting a tie
