# Tictactoe
A tictactoe game with minimax algorithm with X being an AI opponent
The use of minimax alogrithm makes the AI "X" win each time. There are two beginning instances, X going first at the top left corner because the alogrithm recognises it as the best spot to start or "O" goes first, "X" then plays in the middle which still inevitably means "X" will win ultimately fulfilling the goal of "X" always winning or getting a tie
